# Bamazon Node.JS and MySQL application

* **Created:** Saturday, May 5th, 2018

* **Context:** This is the twelfth week's homework assignment as a part of the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp. In this assignment, we are building a NodeJS based application with MySQL for database management and with interactive prompts (through the Inquirer NPM package).  The homework's high level instructions are as follows:

```
In this activity, you'll be creating an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills you learned this week. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. As a bonus task, you can program your app to track product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.
```

* **See a quick walk-through demonstration of the game via the Bamazon_Walkthrough.webm file in this repository**

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

```
* You'll need to have NodeJS installed on your computer since this application has no wep-page front-end
* This application also will require the following:
    * https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer
    * https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql
    
* There are no APIs used in this application so there are no additional setup instructions regarding credential management
* Standard behavior of "npm install" should apply given the provided package.json details
```

### Prerequisites

These are things you need to install the software and how to install them:

```
see 'Getting Started' section above
```

### Installing

These are a set of step-by-step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running:

```
1.) Install NodeJS & some MySQL editor (such as MySQL Workbench)
2.) Clone Git repository
3.) Run 'npm install' from local git directory
4.) Run the file by command 'node bamazonCustomer.js'
5.) Play the game and have a good time!
```
